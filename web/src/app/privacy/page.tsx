          Doomcure (&ldquo;Doomcure&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) is based in {LEGAL_LOCATION}.
          We are building an AI-powered learning experience, and we are at an early stage.
        </p>
        <p>This policy explains how we handle personal data when you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>visit doomcure.com (the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;);</li>
          <li>join our waitlist;</li>
          <li>send us a message through the contact form, or write to us by email.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We follow the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and
          Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 (the &ldquo;SPDI Rules&rdquo;). We are also
          aligning our practices with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 and the Digital Personal Data Protection
          Rules, 2025 (together, the &ldquo;DPDP Law&rdquo;) as their provisions come into force. For the data described in
          this policy, Doomcure decides why and how it is processed, so we act as the <b>Data Fiduciary</b>, and you are the{" "}

        <h3>Data collected automatically</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>IP address:</b> used when you submit a form, to prevent spam and abuse. We store it only as a salted, one-way
            hash, which cannot practically be turned back into your IP address.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Browser information:</b> the user-agent string your browser sends when you submit a form.
          </li>

            <b>Server logs:</b> our hosting provider keeps standard request logs (IP address, date and time, page requested,
            browser type) for security and reliability.

        <h3>Cookies and tracking</h3>
        <p>
          The Website does not use cookies for advertising or analytics, and does not track you across other websites. Fonts
          are served from our own domain, so your browser does not contact third-party font services when you visit. The
          &ldquo;scrolled&rdquo; meter on the homepage is calculated in your browser and is never sent to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we introduce analytics or other non-essential cookies in future, we will update this policy first and ask for
          your consent where the law requires it.
        </p>
        <h3>Data we do not want</h3>
        <p>
          Please do not send us sensitive personal data or information under the SPDI Rules (such as passwords, bank account
          or card details, health information or biometric data) through the Website or by email.
